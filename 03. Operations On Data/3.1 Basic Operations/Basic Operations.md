# Basic Operations

 * Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.

## Addition

 ```
 int sum {number1 + number2};
 int other_sum = number1 + number2 + number1;
 ```

## Subtraction

 ```
 int diff {number1 - number2};
 int other_diff = number1 - number2 - number2;
 ```

## Multiplication

 ```
 int product {number1 * number2};
 int other_product = number1 * 2 * number2;
 ```

## Division

 ```
 int quotient {number1 / number2};
 int other_quotient = number1 / 17;
 ```

 * Division for integers is little tricky, if we take 31 & divide that by 10, we don't going to take a fractional number, it will give us a quotient of 31/10.

 * We have another operator called 'Modulus Operator' which is represent by `%` & it gives us a remainder of Division operation.
 * We only use modulus operator for integer numbers not for floating point numbers.

 ```
 int remainder {number1 % number2};
 int other_remainder {number1 % 6};
 ```
