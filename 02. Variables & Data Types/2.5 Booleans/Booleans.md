* Boolean is a type that can store 2 states, `true` or `false`.
* Booleans is use to make decision in program.

* Boolean store '1' as a **true** value & '0' as a **false** value.

* Boolean occupies **8 bits** (1 Byte) in memory.

* A byte can store 256 different values.
* Using it just to cover two states (true/false) is wasteful, especially for devices with hard memory constraints (think embedded devices).
