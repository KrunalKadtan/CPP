# `int`

 * Stores Decimals
 * Typically occupies 4 bytes or more in memory

## Variable Braced Initialization

 ```
 //Variable may contain random garbage value. WARNING
 int elephant_count;
 
 int lion_count {}; //Initializes to zero

 int dog_count {10}; //Initializes to 10

 int cat_count {15}; //Initializes to 15

 //Can use expression as Initializer
 int domesticated_animals { dog_count + cat_count };

 // Won't compile, the expression in the braces uses undeclared variables
 int bad_initialization { doesnt_exist1 + doesnt_exist2 };

 // 2.9 is of type double, with a wider range than int. ERROR OR WARNING
 int narrowing_conversion {2.9};
 ```

 * Here, in first variable `elephant_count`, we don't give any value to it, so compiler just put in some "Garbage Value" which is not meaningful for our program.
 * As in variable `lion_count`, we mention `{}` which is empty due to which it gets value "0". If we mention any number into it than it will get that value like in other variables `dog_count` & `cat_count`.
 * Also, we can give values as an other variables expression likewise we do it in variable `domesticated_animals` instead of giving direct numerical value we give value of (dog_count + cat_count).
 * We can't use those variables (`doesnt_exist1` & `doesnt_exist2`) in expression which are not declare or define previously in program.
 * If we give a fraction value to an `int` type variable, than compiler will give us a WARNING. Due to this, We can loose some of our data.

## Functional Variable Initialization

 ```
 int apple_count(5);

 int orange_count(10);

 int fruit_count (apple_count + orange_count);

 int bad_initialization ( doesnt_exist3 + doesnt_exist4 );

 //Information lost, less safe than braced initializers
 int narrowing_conversion_functional (2.9);
 ```

 * This is going to do the same thing we show above with curly braces `{}`.
 * Here, In fraction value example, It will silently convert fractional value into integer value, this is called "Implicit Conversion".
 * Here, value '2.9', in implicit conversion, it will remove decimal point & digits after that & only take '2' as a value.
 * It is a bad way to give '2.9' value to an integer. If we want to do like this, it is preferable with `{}`, compiler will show ERROR or WARNING & stop you to do this.

## Assignment Initialization

 ```
 int bike_count = 2;

 int truck_count = 7;

 int vehicle_count = bike_count + truck_count;

 int narrowing_conversion_assignment = 2.9;
 ```

 * We can also give values to variables like this.

## Size Of a Type in Memory

 ```
 std::cout << "Size of int : " << sizeof(int) << std::endl;
 std::cout << "Size of truck_count : " << sizeof(truck_count) << std::endl;
 ```
 
 * To know to size in memory, we can explicitly give `int` or we can directly give name of variable `truck_count`.
